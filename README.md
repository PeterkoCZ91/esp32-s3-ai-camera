**Production-grade AI security camera** built on the DFRobot FireBeetle 2 ESP32-S3 with OV3660 sensor. Lock-free PSRAM ring buffer feeds MJPEG streaming, RTSP, AVI recording, on-device person detection (Edge Impulse FOMO + ByteTrack), and an optional Python YOLO server-side cascade — concurrently from a single camera. MQTT auto-discovery for Home Assistant, Telegram bot, time-lapse, web dashboard with live log. No cloud required.

> [!TIP]
> **New in v3.11** -- 5 detection improvements (temporal filter, night mode rework, sudden-light reset, faster lux sensor, OV3660 ISP tuning), 4× motion detection detail (SCALE_FACTOR 8→4), ByteTrack persistent tracking, live log viewer, time-lapse mode, per-day SD folders.

## In 3 Points

1. **Three concurrent video pipelines from one ESP32-S3.** A lock-free CAS-based ring buffer (3 × 256 KB PSRAM slots) feeds MJPEG streaming, RTSP server, AVI recording, motion detection, FOMO inference, time-lapse, and dashboard snapshots — all simultaneously, **without frame copies**, from a single `captureTask`. The ring buffer protocol uses atomic CAS reference counting (`-1` writer / `0` free / `>0` readers).
2. **Two-stage on-device detection cascade.** Block-based motion detection (~10 ms at 400×300 grayscale) gates Edge Impulse FOMO inference (~150 ms at 64×64 int8) — temporal-filtered for **~90% false-positive reduction** and tracked by a lightweight ByteTrack-style Kalman tracker for persistent IDs (eliminates duplicate notifications for the same person). Optional Python YOLOv11n cascade on a server adds full bounding-box accuracy.
3. **Battle-tested production firmware.** 6+ months of continuous operation, 50+ versions, full Home Assistant MQTT discovery, Telegram bot with 10 commands, OTA updates with auto-rollback, captive portal AP fallback, NVS-encrypted credentials, sabotage detection watchdog, day/night/dusk auto-profiles via LTR-308 lux sensor.

---

## Who Is This For

- **DIY home security users** who want a **self-hosted** AI camera without cloud subscriptions or recurring fees
- **Home Assistant users** looking for a camera that integrates natively via MQTT auto-discovery — motion, person, IR LED, lux, audio — all auto-created
- **Edge AI tinkerers** experimenting with FOMO, lightweight CNN inference, and on-device computer vision on microcontrollers
- **Embedded developers** studying lock-free ring buffers, FreeRTOS task design, ESP32-S3 PSRAM patterns, multi-server HTTP architectures, and SCCB I2C contention workarounds
- **Telegram users** who want photo + AVI video alerts directly to a chat with cooldown, active hours, and command-line control

---

## Quick Start

**~15 minutes from clone to a working camera.**

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/PeterkoCZ91/esp32-s3-ai-camera.git
cd esp32-s3-ai-camera

# 2. Build firmware (uses default safe credentials — set your own later via web GUI)
cd firmware
~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio run --target upload

# 3. Monitor serial — find your IP address
~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio device monitor

# 4. Open the dashboard in a browser
# http://<device-ip>/         (main UI)
# http://<device-ip>/log-viewer  (live log with auto-refresh)
```

### First Boot

After flashing, the device tries:

1. **WiFi credentials from NVS** (if previously configured)
2. **Hardcoded fallback** (set in `credentials.json` during first build)
3. **AP mode fallback** if both fail:
   - **AP name:** `ESP32-Camera-Setup`
   - **AP password:** `12345678`
   - Connect from your phone — captive portal opens automatically
   - Enter your WiFi credentials, click Save, device reboots

Once connected, open the **web dashboard** at `http://<device-ip>/`. The default has no HTTP authentication (`LAB_MODE true` in `config.h`). **Set credentials before exposing to an untrusted network.**

> [!NOTE]
> **Don't know your IP?** Watch the serial monitor for `Local IP: http://192.168.x.x`. The device also advertises mDNS as `ESP32-Camera.local` if your network supports it.

### First Configuration (Web Dashboard)

1. Open `http://<device-ip>/` — the main dashboard
2. Click **Nastaveni** (Settings) — adjust brightness, jpeg quality, motion sensitivity
3. Enable **Foto: ZAP** to send Telegram photos on motion (requires Telegram token in `/credentials`)
4. Enable **Osoba AI: ZAP** to enable the FOMO person detection cascade
5. Open **Live Log** to watch real-time events as you trigger motion in front of the camera

### Optional: Python YOLO Cascade

```bash
cd a12_system
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp config.env.example config.env   # Edit ESP32_IP and optional MQTT/Telegram tokens
python3 -m A12_System_v2
```

The Python cascade pulls the MJPEG stream from `http://<device-ip>:81/detection-stream`, runs YOLOv11n inference, and publishes results to MQTT alongside the camera's own FOMO detection.

## How It Works

The OV3660 sensor captures JPEG frames into a single FreeRTOS `captureTask` running on Core 1. Frames land in a **lock-free 3-slot ring buffer in PSRAM** using atomic CAS reference counting — no copies, no mutex contention. Multiple consumer tasks read frames concurrently:

```
   OV3660 Sensor (~30 FPS UXGA)
        |
        v
  +------------+      +-------------------+
  | captureTask|----->|  Ring Buffer      |
  | (Core 1,   |      |  3 x 256 KB PSRAM |
  |  prio 10)  |      |  CAS atomic refs  |

### Ring Buffer Protocol (CAS-Based)

```
  ref_count semantics:
   -1 = writer (captureTask) is writing to this slot
    0 = slot is free
   >0 = number of active readers

  Writer (captureTask):
    1. CAS slot[i].ref_count from 0 to -1 (try to claim)
    2. memcpy frame data
    3. Memory barrier (__sync_synchronize)
    4. Update current_frame_index = i
    5. CAS slot[i].ref_count from -1 to 0 (release)

  Reader (any consumer task):
    1. idx = current_frame_index (with barrier)
    2. CAS slot[idx].ref_count from N to N+1 (increment)
    3. Read frame data
    4. Atomic decrement slot[idx].ref_count
```

The protocol guarantees:
- No reader blocks the writer
- No writer blocks readers
- Multiple readers can access the same frame simultaneously
- Old frames are not freed until all readers release them

## Detection Pipeline

Two-stage cascade with temporal filtering and persistent tracking:

```
  Frame ----> [Motion: 400x300 grayscale, EMA bg model, 4x4 blocks]
                |
                |  motion confirmed (2+ frames, clustered)
                v
              [FOMO: 64x64 int8, ~150ms inference]
                |
                |  raw detections (centroids)
                v
              [Tracker: ByteTrack-style Kalman, persistent IDs]
                |
                |  confirmed track (2+ hits, not yet notified)
                v
              [Temporal filter: 2+ consecutive frames]
                |
                v
            Telegram + MQTT alert + JPG/AVI on SD
```

### Motion Detection (motion_detection.cpp)

Block-based frame differencing against an EMA background model. The whole pipeline runs in ~10 ms at 400×300 working resolution.

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Working resolution** | 400×300 (UXGA / 4) | 4× more detail than v3.10 (was 200×150) |
| Block size | 4 × 4 pixels | Natural low-pass filter — single noisy pixel = 1/16 of block |
| Pixel diff threshold | 20 + AGC gain | Adaptive to sensor noise (gain 0 → 20, gain 30 → 50) |
| Pixel threshold (night) | × 2.5 | Boosted at night to filter sensor noise |
| Trigger percentage | 5% | Min blocks changed to trigger |
| Trigger pct (night) | × 2.5 | Stricter at night |
| Upper bound | 70% | Above = global light change, rejected |
| Confirm frames | 2 | Consecutive frames required |
| EMA alpha (day) | 0.92 | Background adaptation rate |
| EMA alpha (night) | 0.97 | Slower at night to suppress sensor noise |
| Cluster requirement | 1+ neighbor (day), 2+ (night) | 4-connected adjacency |
| Brightness reset | Δ > 80/255 between frames | Background reset on sudden light change |
| ROI mask | Per-block on/off | Configurable via `/roi-mask` API |

**Night mode** (avg brightness < 10): instead of blanket suppress, the detector requires stricter clustering and higher pixel thresholds — actual night motion is detected while sensor noise is filtered.

**Sudden light change**: when average brightness jumps by more than 80/255 between consecutive frames (e.g. lights turned on, sunset, headlights), the EMA background is instantly reset to the current frame to prevent false motion during the transition.

### Person Detection (person_detection.cpp)

Edge Impulse FOMO model running on the ring buffer's latest JPEG frame:

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Model | Edge Impulse FOMO | int8 quantized CNN |
| Input resolution | 64 × 64 grayscale | Fixed by FOMO architecture |
| Decode scale | JPG_SCALE_4X | UXGA → 400 × 300 → bilinear → 64 × 64 |
| Tensor arena | 140 KB PSRAM | |
| Min detections | 2 centroids | Spatial filter (single = noise) |
| **Temporal filter** | **2 consecutive frames** | Eliminates ~90% false positives |
| Histogram normalization | 1%-99% percentile stretch | Skipped if range < 20 (true night) |
| Inference time | ~100-200 ms | Logged in `result.inference_ms` |

### Object Tracker (tracker.cpp)

Lightweight ByteTrack-style tracker with constant-velocity prediction and greedy matching:

| Feature | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Max tracks | 16 simultaneous | Static SRAM allocation (~1 KB) |
| Track lifecycle | TENTATIVE → CONFIRMED → LOST → DELETED | |
| Min hits to confirm | 2 | Tentative tracks promoted after 2 successful matches |
| Max age | 30 frames | Lost tracks deleted after 30 frames without re-match |
| Max distance | 80 pixels | Greedy nearest-neighbor matching radius |
| Velocity smoothing | α = 0.7 (old) + 0.3 (new) | Exponential moving average |
| Per-frame cost | ~2-5 ms | |
| **Persistent IDs** | Yes | Same person stays same track ID until they leave |
| **Notification dedup** | Yes | `notified` flag prevents duplicate Telegram for same track |

The tracker is the answer to the v3.10.5 "person detection re-check photo spam" problem — same person now triggers a notification once, and only fires again when a new track is created.

### Camera Profiles (ir_handler.cpp)

Auto-switching between three camera tunings based on ambient light from the LTR-308 sensor:

| Profile | Lux range | Brightness | AE level | Gain ceiling | LENC | Use case |
|---------|-----------|------------|----------|--------------|------|----------|
| **DAY** | > 250 | 0 | 0 | 16× | ON | Daylight, bright indoor |
| **DUSK** | 5–250 | +3 | +5 | 128× | ON | Twilight, dim indoor |
| **NIGHT** | < 5 | +3 | +5 | 128× | OFF | Pure dark, IR LED active |

**LTR-308 sensor:** 100 ms integration time / 100 ms sample rate (was 500 ms in v3.10), giving 5× faster reaction to sunset, headlights, room lights. Lux is read every 100 ms via the shared I2C bus from `captureTask` (after frame return) to avoid SCCB contention with the camera driver.

**OV3660 ISP tuning** (init-time, SCCB-safe):
- LENC (lens correction) — corrects vignetting at corners
- BPC + WPC auto-adaptation — masks defective pixels
- SDE (Special Digital Effects) — contrast, saturation, brightness pipeline
- 2D Noise Reduction — UV chroma denoise

The dashboard auto-refreshes status every 3 seconds and shows **Offline** if the camera stops responding.

---

## Telegram Bot

Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), add the token + chat ID to NVS via `/credentials` POST or the web dashboard.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/foto` | Take a photo and send it now |
| `/video N` | Record N seconds of AVI (3-60 s) and send as document |
| `/nahraj` | Start AVI recording (auto-stops on size or time limit) |
| `/status` | Send system status (uptime, IP, RSSI, heap, profile, version) |
| `/detekce` | Toggle motion → Telegram photo |
| `/osoba` | Toggle person detection AI cascade |
| `/ir` | Toggle IR LED |
| `/hlidej` | Activate guard mode (motion + AI both ON) |
| `/ticho` | Mute notifications |
| `/restart` | Restart ESP32 |
| `/help` | Show command list |

**Cooldown:** Telegram messages have a configurable cooldown (default 60 s) to prevent notification spam during continuous activity. Active hours (`motion_notify_start_hour` / `end_hour`) silence notifications during quiet periods.

**Photo upload:** Uses `WiFiClientSecure.setInsecure()` (skips cert validation, fits ESP32-S3 RAM constraints). Multipart upload streams in 2 KB chunks to avoid WiFi buffer overflow.

**Document upload:** AVI files are streamed directly from SD without loading into RAM — supports up to 50 MB files.

## Camera & Sensor Quirks

> [!WARNING]
> The OV3660 sensor has several behaviors that are not documented in the standard `sensor_t` API. Working around them required several iterations.

### SCCB Bus Contention

**The problem:** The OV3660 uses an I2C-like serial bus (SCCB) for register access. The `esp32-camera` driver holds this bus during every frame capture (~33 ms at 30 FPS). Any `set_reg()` or `get_reg()` call from another task **silently fails** and returns `0xFF` because `captureTask` is holding the bus.

**Symptoms:**
- HTTP POST `/settings` returns 200 OK but settings don't take effect
- Log shows "register write failed" or values revert
- Reading current register state returns `0xFF` for everything

**Workaround:** A `pendingSensorAction` flag mechanism in `captureTask`:
1. HTTP handler sets the flag with intended changes
2. `captureTask` reads the flag after `fb_return()` (when SCCB is free)
3. Settings are applied within the same task that owns the SCCB

This means runtime settings changes have a **latency of one frame** (~33 ms), but they actually work.

### LTR-308 I2C Bus Sharing

**The problem:** The LTR-308 ambient light sensor and the OV3660 SCCB share GPIO 8/9. Direct LTR-308 reads from a separate task were stuck on bus contention.

**Workaround:** Lux is read from `captureTask` (after `fb_return()`) every 100 ms. The cached value is exposed to other tasks via a non-blocking getter.

### OV3660 Cannot Upscale

**The problem:** The OV3660 can downscale at runtime, but cannot upscale. If you initialize at VGA, you cannot switch to UXGA later — the sensor returns garbage frames or fails entirely.

**Workaround:** Always initialize at the highest resolution you might want (UXGA 1600 × 1200), then downscale at runtime if needed. Memory penalty: 256 KB ring buffer slots instead of 64 KB, but the OV3660's 3 MP sensor fully utilizes UXGA.

### ESP-NN Heap Corruption

**The problem:** Edge Impulse FOMO with `ESP_NN=1` (hardware acceleration) causes heap corruption on ESP32-S3 with PSRAM enabled.

**Workaround:** `ESP_NN=0` in `platformio.ini` build flags. Inference is ~10% slower but stable.

```ini
build_flags =
    -DEI_CLASSIFIER_TFLITE_ENABLE_ESP_NN=0
```

### Camera Init Pixel Correction

**The problem:** Some OV3660 modules ship with stuck pixels visible as bright dots in dark frames. The default BPC/WPC settings don't catch all of them.

**Workaround:** Init-time register writes enable BPC/WPC auto-adaptation (`0x5025`) and 2D noise reduction (`0x5580`). These features are not exposed in the `sensor_t` API.

---

## Compile-Time Feature Toggles

Edit `firmware/config.h` and rebuild to disable features and save flash + RAM:

```cpp
#define INCLUDE_TELEGRAM       // ~30 KB flash + Telegram queue + WiFiClientSecure
#define INCLUDE_MQTT           // ~25 KB flash + PubSubClient
#define INCLUDE_AUDIO          // ~15 KB flash + I2S buffer RAM
#define INCLUDE_PERSON_DETECT  // ~280 KB flash + 384 KB PSRAM (FOMO model)
#define INCLUDE_SD_RECORDING   // ~40 KB flash + AVI muxer
#define INCLUDE_TIMELAPSE      // ~5 KB flash + 1 task
```

To disable a feature, comment out the `#define`:

```cpp
// #define INCLUDE_TELEGRAM   // Disabled
```

The build system automatically excludes the corresponding code via `#ifdef` guards. Stub functions are provided for disabled Telegram so the rest of the code compiles unchanged.

**Example:** A minimal build with motion detection only:
```cpp
// #define INCLUDE_TELEGRAM
// #define INCLUDE_MQTT
// #define INCLUDE_AUDIO
// #define INCLUDE_PERSON_DETECT
// #define INCLUDE_SD_RECORDING
// #define INCLUDE_TIMELAPSE
```
Reduces flash usage by ~395 KB and PSRAM usage by ~400 KB.

## Known Issues & Limitations

> [!WARNING]
> `LAB_MODE true` is the default in `config.h`. This **bypasses HTTP basic auth** on mutable endpoints. Set to `false` and configure HTTP credentials via `/credentials` POST before exposing the device to an untrusted network.

<details>
<summary><strong>Hardware / Platform limitations (won't fix)</strong></summary>

- **OV3660 cannot upscale at runtime** — only frame size *down*-changes work. The camera initializes at UXGA and resizes downward.
- **SCCB bus contention** — runtime `set_reg`/`get_reg` calls fail because `captureTask` holds the bus. Workaround: pending-flag mechanism applies settings within `captureTask`.
- **I2C bus shared with LTR-308** — light sensor and camera SCCB share GPIO 8/9. Lux reads scheduled from `captureTask` after each frame return.
- **ESP-NN must stay disabled** — Edge Impulse FOMO with hardware NN acceleration causes heap corruption on ESP32-S3 with PSRAM.
- **PDM mic limited to 16 kHz mono** — stereo or higher sample rates require external I2S MEMS mic on different GPIO.
- **arduino-esp32 3.0.0 pinned** — newer cores (3.3.0+) have a regression with FOMO inference (`cam_hal: DMA overflow`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Software limitations</strong></summary>

- **`LAB_MODE true`** — bypasses HTTP auth on mutable endpoints by default. Production deployment requires manual flip.
- **No HTTPS** — all HTTP endpoints are plain. Telegram uses TLS via `WiFiClientSecure.setInsecure()` (skips cert validation).
- **FOMO 64×64 false positives** — small objects are inherently noisy. Mitigated by spatial filter (2+ centroids) + temporal filter (2+ frames) + ByteTrack tracker. Future: replace with ESP-DL YOLOv11n (see `MIGRATION_ESP_DL.md`).
- **AVI auto-stop** — recording stops at 45 MB or 120 s. No segmented recording yet (planned).
- **MQTT min heap** — connection requires ~25 KB free heap; under heavy load, MQTT may disconnect.
- **NTP required** for time-lapse and SD per-day folders — no internet = no per-day organization.
- **Web UI is gzipped PROGMEM string** — editing requires firmware rebuild.
- **No multi-camera coordination** — each camera is independent (planned).

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Camera doesn't show up on the network after flashing</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** No IP shown in serial monitor, web dashboard unreachable.

**Causes & fixes:**
1. **WiFi credentials missing** — connect to AP `ESP32-Camera-Setup` (password: `12345678`) from your phone, captive portal opens automatically
2. **Wrong WiFi credentials** — same as above, re-enter via captive portal
3. **5 GHz WiFi network** — ESP32-S3 supports 2.4 GHz only. Make sure your router has 2.4 GHz enabled.
4. **AP isolation enabled on router** — disable client isolation in router settings
5. **DHCP exhausted** — assign a static IP from your router's settings

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Build fails with "DMA overflow" or memory errors</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** `cam_hal: DMA overflow` or `Guru Meditation Error` at boot.

**Cause:** ESP32 Arduino core 3.3.0+ has a regression with FOMO inference and DMA buffers. Some users on the [Edge Impulse forum](https://forum.edgeimpulse.com/t/14723) report this.

**Fix:** Pin `arduino-espressif32` to `3.0.0` in `platformio.ini` (already the default in this project):
```ini
platform_packages =
    framework-arduinoespressif32 @ https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32.git#3.0.0
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Person detection has too many false positives at night</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** FOMO triggers on noise patches in dark frames, IR LED reflections, or moving shadows.

**Cause:** Histogram normalization stretches dark frames into IR sensor noise; FOMO model trained on full-range images.

**Fix:** Already mitigated in v3.11:
1. `normalizeContrast()` skips frames with range < 20 (true night)
2. Temporal filter requires 2+ consecutive detected frames
3. ByteTrack tracker requires 2+ hits before confirming a track

If issues persist, increase `PD_TEMPORAL_FRAMES` from 2 to 3 in `person_detection.h` and rebuild. Or disable person detection at night via active hours.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Telegram bot doesn't respond to commands</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** Bot doesn't reply to `/foto`, `/status`, etc.

**Causes & fixes:**
1. **Token wrong or chat ID wrong** — POST new credentials via `/credentials` in the web GUI
2. **Bot not added to chat** — for group chats, the bot must be a member; use [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to find your chat ID
3. **`getUpdates` polling not running** — watch serial for `Telegram polling` log lines every 30 s
4. **Network issue** — Telegram API requires outbound HTTPS (port 443)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>SD card recording fails to start</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** `/record` returns 500, serial shows `SD Card Mount Failed`.

**Causes & fixes:**
1. **SD card not detected** — check wiring, try a different card slot
2. **Card too slow** — use Class 10 or U1+ minimum (recording at 10 FPS UXGA needs ~3 MB/s sustained writes)
3. **Filesystem corrupt** — reformat as FAT32 (NOT exFAT — ESP32 SD library doesn't support it)
4. **SPI frequency too high** — try lowering from 4 MHz to 1 MHz in `camera_server.cpp` `startCameraServer()` for marginal cards

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>MQTT not connecting / no Home Assistant entities</strong></summary>

**Causes & fixes:**
1. **MQTT server IP wrong** — check `/credentials` GET (with HTTP auth) — if `mqtt_server` is empty, POST new credentials
2. **MQTT broker not running** — verify with `mosquitto_sub -h <broker> -t '#'` from another machine
3. **Wrong MQTT credentials** — check broker logs for failed auth attempts
4. **HA discovery prefix wrong** — default is `homeassistant`, must match HA's `mqtt:` config
5. **Free heap too low** — MQTT publish needs ~20 KB. Check `/health` for `min_heap` field.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Camera restarts every 30-200 seconds</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** Sabotage alarm fires repeatedly, web dashboard reconnects every few minutes.

**Causes & fixes:**
1. **Power supply too weak** — 5V 1A minimum required, IR LED + WiFi can spike higher
2. **WiFi RSSI too weak** — check `/status` for `wifi_rssi`. Below -85 dBm = unstable.
3. **Heap fragmentation** — check `/health` for `min_heap`. Below 30 KB = OOM imminent.
4. **WDT timeout** — increase WDT timeout in `main.cpp` if a long-running task triggers it
5. **Sabotage timeout too tight** — increase `security.sabotage_timeout` in config (default 30 s)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Factory reset</strong></summary>

To clear all NVS credentials and config:

```bash
~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio run --target erase
~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio run --target upload
```

Or via the web GUI: `/credentials` POST with empty fields. Then reboot.

The device will enter AP mode for fresh configuration.

</details>

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need Home Assistant?</strong></summary>

No. The camera works fully standalone with the web dashboard, RTSP server, and Telegram bot. Home Assistant adds remote control and nice dashboards via MQTT auto-discovery, but it's optional.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this with Frigate / BlueIris / Synology Surveillance Station?</strong></summary>

Yes — point them at the RTSP URL: `rtsp://<device-ip>:554/mjpeg/1`. The camera streams MJPEG which is supported by all major NVR software. You can also use the MJPEG stream directly: `http://<device-ip>:81/stream`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How accurate is the on-device person detection?</strong></summary>

The Edge Impulse FOMO model is good at detecting **medium-sized people in well-lit scenes** (person occupies ~10-30% of frame). It's poor at:
- Distant people (small targets)
- Profile views or partial occlusions
- Low-light scenes
- Crowded scenes (FOMO is centroid-based, not bounding boxes)

For higher accuracy, use the **server-side YOLOv11n cascade** in `a12_system/` which runs on a desktop / Raspberry Pi and processes the MJPEG stream.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How much does it cost to run?</strong></summary>

About **$45 one-time** for hardware (DFRobot board + SD card + power supply). **No subscriptions, no cloud fees, no recurring costs.** Power consumption is ~2W average (~0.5 kWh/month at 24/7 operation = ~$0.10/month).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens when WiFi goes down?</strong></summary>

The camera continues capturing locally and writing to SD if recording is enabled. MQTT publish silently fails until reconnect. Telegram messages also fail (no offline buffer for Telegram yet). When WiFi returns, the camera auto-reconnects (exponential backoff up to 60 s).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I add multiple cameras?</strong></summary>

Yes — flash the same firmware to multiple boards. Each identifies itself by MAC address and gets its own MQTT topic prefix (configurable). Multi-camera mesh coordination is on the roadmap.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does the camera work in complete darkness?</strong></summary>

With the on-board IR LED, yes — at distances up to ~3 m. For longer range (5-10 m), add an external IR illuminator. The OV3660 sensor is sensitive to IR (no IR-cut filter), so you get a clear B&W night image. The camera profile auto-switches to NIGHT mode when lux < 5.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I record 4K?</strong></summary>

No — the OV3660 is a 3 MP (UXGA 1600×1200) sensor. For higher resolution, you'd need a different camera module (M5Stack CamS3 5MP with OV5640 is on the roadmap).

</details>

## Security & Privacy

<details>
<summary><strong>Data handling</strong></summary>

- **All processing happens on-device** (motion + AI detection)
- **No cloud telemetry** — the camera does not phone home or send analytics
- Recordings stored only on your local SD card (or sent to your Telegram chat / MQTT broker)
- A12 Python cascade runs on **your local server**, no third-party AI APIs
- Credentials stored in NVS (encrypted), never serialized to JSON or logs
- Live log buffer is in-memory only, lost on reboot

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Network exposure</strong></summary>

- **Port 80** — HTTP API + dashboard (basic auth optional, off in `LAB_MODE`)
- **Port 81** — MJPEG streams (no auth — see warning below)
- **Port 82** — audio WAV stream (no auth)
- **Port 554** — RTSP server (no auth — VLC and Frigate use this)
- **Outbound** — Telegram (TLS), MQTT (plain or TLS depending on broker), HTTP OTA endpoint

> [!WARNING]
> **Recommended deployment:** Isolate the camera to a dedicated IoT VLAN. **Never** expose ports 80/81/82/554 directly to the public internet. Use a reverse proxy with HTTPS + auth (Caddy, nginx, traefik) if remote access is needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Credential storage</strong></summary>

- WiFi SSID + password — NVS (encrypted)
- HTTP basic auth user/pass — NVS (encrypted)
- OTA password — NVS (encrypted)
- AP mode password — NVS (encrypted)
- Telegram bot token + chat ID — NVS (encrypted)
- MQTT user + password — NVS (encrypted)

NVS is encrypted on ESP32-S3 with secure boot enabled. Without secure boot, NVS data is readable from flash with physical access — but not over the network.
